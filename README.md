FAQ
---
How can I run the codes without installing python?
If you have python installed on your machine, directly go to the folder using 'cd' command and execute the '.py' file.
Python does not includes a compiler to translate a program to machine language (although it compiles to .pyc bytecode files).
To create an executable file from a python script you will have to install an additional package like PyInstaller.
PyInstaller gathers all dependencies and produces a single file that can be run from the system prompt, even if Python is not installed on a computer. 
For more information see PyInstaller Manual(link: https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
The resulting executable can only be run on the same operating system on which it was generated.
