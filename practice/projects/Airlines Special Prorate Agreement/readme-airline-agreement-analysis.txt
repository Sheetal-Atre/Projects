One such type of agreements are Special Prorate Agreement(SPA). SPA Analysis is analysis of the agreements between two or more airlines to increase profitability by different ways. Some of the ways are by releasing low revenue generating seats to the partner airlines, adding routes, or by making agreements with other partner airlines. Commercial teams may change the current SPA based on the analyses provided to maximise revenue. The analysis of the agreements has 2 different views:
1. Analyze current SPA behavior:  
The idea of it is to present the data in different manners we can help the airlines to understand performance of each agreement and its impact over the business.
In short answer the question, 
    2. How is the behavior of the agreement - is revenue increasing?
    3. Is it being applied? 
    4. How much revenue airline is getting for this SPA?
    5. Would prorating with standard rules(MPA) be better?

1. To understand revenue agreement generated to my Total Revenue
2. To compare the contribution of this agreement vs other agreements and with my own Revenue by route/O&D. 
For example IB and AF offer to carriers similar routes connection for carriers arriving to Europe, Which of those SPAs is better for me? 
3. Am I displacing better incomes by applying this agreement?, in other words, by giving a seat on my flights to the partner I have lost revenue that could have been higher if my own clients would have use it?
4. Should I allocate more or less capacity to the fare-class given in this agreement? The fare-class given in the agreement, are correct today, should I make changes? 
5. By having this agreement and hence the flight connections that I get from it, what is the revenue that I obtain for my own sectors in my own sales, this revenue will be lost if don't have the agreement or if my flights don't connect to the partner ones. How those revenues have evolved? 
6. Can I obtain from the tool the general revenue opening per company, agreements, non-agreements and own revenue? By route, Origin-Destination, Class, Fare Basis and Flight. 
7. Can I understand if there is seasonality in the demand for my flights by agreement, company, country, origin, etc. ??? 
8. Can I get the advance purchase comparing the date of issue and the date of the first coupon? To understand better what I should expect in the future? 
9.	Can I compare the gross/net income per coupon/company for a specific route/O&D, with flight opening? 
10.	Can I obtain an interline invoicing balance with the companies inside and outside the agreements, to know how much revenue are generating for me vs the revenue that I´m generating for them? 
11.	To understand the distribution channel cost, so the client can understand the true revenue for the coupons.

1.	Analyze “what if” scenarios: This is what the system do today, answering the question of What will happened if I change the conditions of the currents SPA? 
    So, by changing those conditions system gives the new revenue using real data 
    
    Scenario 1
SPA value (for the TKTs that SPA have been applied)	MPA value (for the TKTs that SPA have not been applied)	Total Value
Carrier 1			SPA+MPA

b.	To have the graph by coupon count: to review if the SPA is being applied or not in each scenario and type pf graph



#### Other tasks:
1. Can I have access to a PivotTable that allows me to create reports that are updated by themselves? 
2. Can I generate a custom dashboard for my company and use? Focusing on the variables I want to monitor regularly. 

Transfer the SPA data from production environment where RA Team works
To Analyzer Environment where Commercial Team Works
To UAT Environment where RA team will receive the new attachments signed from the Commercial team

#### Reports:
Open fare class report: to separate it by carriers or group of carriers 

Fare basis: carrier-wise

Sector report: gives detail view of the real sectors revenue. Also option by country to country or regions to regions like Europe to America

Carrier revenue: have revenue for all coupons like this:
SPA value (for the TKTs that SPA have been applied)	Total Value = SPA+MPA

Agreement validity reports to know when I need to renegotiate with the company? 
Alerts of expiring SPAs within next 60-90 days was used to highlight SPA Validity period of so that commercial team gets enough time to study and make changes to it.
